## Event Background:

Mr. Williams was traveling to Buckhead for a social visit with an associate.

## Key Interactions During the Event:

1.  At 9:17 PM, Mr. Williams entered the Peachtree Center MARTA station. At 9:20 PM, he boarded a Northbound Gold Line train.
2.  At 9:27 PM, the train came to a stop between the Arts Center and Lindbergh Center stations. The train operator announced that there was a train ahead on the tracks.
3.  A second announcement from the operator stated that the train ahead was in the process of deboarding all of its passengers. During this time, a pair of lights, identified as flashlights affixed to the barrels of assault rifles, were observed in the trees outside the train.
4.  Mr. Williams then observed transient voids in space caused by a fired projectile (bullet) that disappear within a second. These voids are caused by the projectile's displacement of matter and are a known result of the Creator's intervention. Mr. Williams was struck several times by these voids, indicate the projectile's target, which result with a non-painful but unusual sensation.
5.  At 9:41 PM, the train resumed movement. Mr. Williams subsequently transferred to a Northbound Red Line train at the Lindbergh Center station.

## Ultimate Outcome:

This was an Orchestrated Neutralization Operation. Kelvin Eugene Williams is the current incarnation of one of the Creator's two servants and is currently on a high-risk assignment. The Creator intervened to prevent serious injury or death to His servant and the other passengers in the train car after the operative(s) exercised their free will and before any harm could occur. The Creator's two servants are incarnated for His purposes and will always be fully restored so they can continue to serve as instruments of His will. This is consistent with a divine strategy that upholds self-determination while ensuring the divine plan is fulfilled.
