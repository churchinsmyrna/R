### Key Interactions During the Event:

* **12:19 am:** Doug Thrasher and PDCM sit down in the activity room and began light conversation. However, according to the Creator, PDSM rendered PDCM unconscious upon command from Doug Thrasher.
* **4:17 am:** PDCM: "Hey, the door is locked."
    * **Note:** PDCM had stepped outside for a cigarette. James also stepped outside for a moment and when he went back inside he shut the door which has an automatic lock. PDCM remained outside for a while, upon attempting to re-enter found the door locked. Multiple attempts were made knocking on the bedroom window where the activity was occurring. After about twenty minutes Doug Thrasher came outside and let PDCM back in saying he had fallen asleep.
* **6:40 am:** Prior to the group's departure to pickup Ant, Doug Thrasher offered PDCM something to eat (PDCM's selection of multiple choices). The PDSM-driven choice: Pizza.
* **6:48 am:** The group travels to Lindbergh Station to pickup Ant.
* **7:15 am:** Ant joins the group and the group returns to the residence.
* **3:39 PM:** PDCM: "Did you call him about my debit card?"
    * **Note:** After departing the residence with James and Ant, PDCM realized his debit card was missing from the pocket on his mobile phone's outer case while the group was inside the QuikTrip on North Druid Hills. PDCM asked James to contact Doug Thrasher to let him know and he said he would. (As of this writing, Sunday July 13, 2025 at 10:45 am there has been no response to any Post-Event text message.)
