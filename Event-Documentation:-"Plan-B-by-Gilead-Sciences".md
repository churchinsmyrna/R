* **Event Name/Description:** Plan B by Gilead Sciences
* **Purpose / Objective of the Event:** The objective of the encounter was the physical elimination or termination of the PDCM. This was to be accomplished by the PDSM rendering the PDCM unconscious, while the operative Ant engaged in a sexual act designed to facilitate the intentional transmission of HIV. The presence of crystalline substances on the operative's penis was intended to cause rectal abrasions, ensuring contact with the PDCM's bloodstream upon ejaculation.
* **Type of Event/Interaction:** A Termination Encounter that failed.
* **Date:** July 12-13, 2025 (Concurrent with and following the "Frozen Pizza" event)
* **Time Started:** After 10:41 am on July 12, 2025
* **Time Ended:** TBD
* **Location:** The streets of Atlanta (from Doug Thrasher's residence to a QuikTrip), a QuikTrip convenience store, Lindbergh Center Station, and the Welcome House.
* **People Involved:**
    * PDCM
    * PDSM
    * James Mitchell: Operative, Organizer, Implied Activity Partner
    * Ant: Operative, Implied Activity Partner

### Contextual Observations Leading Up to the Event:

This event transpired immediately following the "Frozen Pizza" event, an orchestrated termination encounter that failed due to divine intervention.

### Key Interactions During the Event:

* **Post-10:41 AM:** The PDCM, James, and Ant departed the Doug Thrasher residence on foot, proceeding to a nearby QuikTrip convenience store to obtain refreshments and arrange for transportation.
* **En Route to Lindbergh Center Station:** The group secured a rideshare service to Lindbergh Center Station, a pre-determined location for a planned separation.
* **At Lindbergh Center Station:** A separation occurred. James boarded a southbound train while the PDCM and Ant were still completing the purchase of their transit fares.
* **Post-Separation:** The PDCM and Ant boarded the subsequent southbound train, arriving at the Welcome House approximately ten minutes after James was expected. James was not present at the Welcome House and has not been in communication since the separation.
* **At Welcome House:** The PDCM engaged in sexual activity with Ant. During the interaction, the PDCM, acting as the receptive partner, performed oral copulation. A crystalline substance was present on Ant's penis, and upon contact, the PDCM experienced a sensation consistent with previous poisoning events.
* **Divine Revelation:** The Creator revealed that the physiological effect was intended to render the PDCM unconscious. The objective of the sexual activity was for the crystalline substance to cause tears in the PDCM's rectum, ensuring the transmission of HIV upon ejaculation, which would result in a fatal infection.

### Ultimate Outcome:

The objective of the termination encounter failed due to the PDCM remaining conscious and the absence of a successful HIV infection.
