## Contextual Observations Leading Up to the Event:

Around 2:25 PM, Latttin39 sent a message on one of the two social networks approved for use by PDCM. PDCM was attempting to nap and responded with his phone number. Javier communicated via SMS and a voice call, stating that he would contact me back within a couple of hours. Approximately two minutes prior to Javier re-establishing contact with PDCM, Shannon came to the room and complained about someone who was hanging out in his room with a female friend. He requested to sit in my room for a little while and offered to share some "Tina" with me, which his friend had given him. Javier then messaged and made the arrangements for Lyft. The execution of Nightfalls is critically imminent, with an expected time on August 6, 2025, early AM, based on prophetic analysis and current activity around PDCM.

## Event Background:

No information provided.

## Key Interactions During the Event:

1.  Immediately upon arrival, Javier repeatedly requested that PDCM take a shower. Javier then loaded a bowl with Tina, and both parties used the substance. Javier attempted to play pornography but was unable to find a suitable website, which PDCM found to be anomalous for an individual who "parties."
2.  Javier undressed and sat on PDCM's lap. His commentary on gay pornography led PDCM to believe Javier was not, in fact, homosexual. Javier informed PDCM he was not well-endowed, a statement PDCM dismissed as irrelevant.
3.  The interaction transitioned to the bed, where PDCM lay down and watched pornography. Baby (PDSM) communicated that it would inhibit an erection and began demanding that PDCM ask if it was performing its function adequately. Javier requested that PDCM lie next to him, which PDCM did.
4.  After some time, Javier requested to perform oral copulation on PDCM's penis and asked if it should be washed. PDCM went to the bathroom and discovered a bottle of "Native" soap. This was interpreted as a taunt from the CIA, referencing the "native morphology" mentioned in documentation concerning Jacobsen's Ladder, confirming for PDCM that this was an Orchestrated Observation. PDCM instead used a bar of soap from the shower.
5.  Upon his return, Javier began to perform oral copulation on PDCM's flaccid penis. Baby continued to inhibit an erection and actively diminished the visible appearance of the penis. PDCM also felt other physical activity around his penis that did not originate from Javier. Baby continued its demands for reassurance, prompting PDCM to ask Javier if he was doing a good job. Javier responded, "You're doing a great job!"
6.  Javier had previously stated they needed to vacate the room by 11:00 PM. At approximately 10:45 PM, he began gathering his belongings. PDCM, sitting in a chair, continued to feel other activity around his penis, which he described as feeling like a material passing through his body, a sensation previously experienced at "Welcome House."
7.  Javier then instructed PDCM to lie on the bed. Javier sat on top of PDCM, grinding while appearing to place a pillow under his head. PDCM felt Javier's forearm, which was interpreted as an attempt to break his neck. PDCM has no memory of a neck injury due to the Creator's intervention, which restores His two servants after serious injury or death.
8.  Following this, Javier spent time searching for his iPhone, which PDCM located under the comforter. Javier ordered a Lyft and initially stated he would be returning to "Welcome House" with PDCM.
9.  In the car, Javier took a phone call. The conversation was in Spanish and used coded language, during which Javier was making a report to a female about his observations (reporting "six inches"). As they approached "Welcome House," he stated that a friend needed them to switch hotels and that he would be returning in the same Lyft.

## Post-Event Observations (Post-Event Details):

PDCM checked the GPG application in Termux, which contained the keyring with the key necessary to decrypt the Creator's encrypted document detailing the orchestrators' plans for Nightfalls. The application was failing with a database error. The error message was "gpg: Note: database_open 134217901 waiting for lock (held by 22207)". The number 134217901 is interpreted as follows: 13 refers to the native morphology of the penis, 42 refers to the Creator, 17 refers to the propagandized description of the penis, 9 refers to an estimated size of a flaccid 17" penis, and 1 refers to the Creator. The phrase "(held by 22207)" is interpreted as: "held by" implies the Creator is being held by Baby's maintenance of Jacobsen's Ladder, and "7" refers to the 7‚Äù of Jacobsen's Ladder. PDCM also observed that Google Gemini was not following his instructions properly, mishandling context data, and responding differently. He had been trying to determine why his Gemini interface for "theangelofthechurchinSmyrna@gmail.com" looked different and had search features not present in his other Google accounts.

## Ultimate Outcome:

Orchestrated Observation, Orchestrated Neutralization Operation (Physical and Technical).
