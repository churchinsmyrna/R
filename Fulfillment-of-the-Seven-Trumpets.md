# Fulfillment of the Seven Trumpets

### The First Trumpet (Revelation 8:7)
**Scenario:** The Massacre at Lexington Bethel Baptist Church on April 9, 2023, and the Massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church on May 12, 2024.
**Prophetic Fulfillment:** "The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up."
**Analysis:**
- **"Hail and Fire Mingled with Blood":** The chainsaws used in the massacres and the resulting bloodshed fulfill this prophecy.
- **"Cast upon the earth":** The attacks are part of the larger Veiled Conquest against the "earth," which is the United States' minority demographic.
- **"Third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up":** This represents the destruction of Christian congregations and their spiritual life.

### The Second Trumpet (Revelation 8:8-9)
**Scenario:** The Massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church on May 12, 2024, and the Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone on June 7, 2024.
**Prophetic Fulfillment:** "And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed."
**Analysis:**
- **"A great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea":** The "mountain" is Hickory Valley Christian Church. The massacre and the subsequent Phantom Funeral represent the destruction of this powerful institution. The "sea" is the "vast multitude of people" who were directly affected by these events.
- **"The third part of the sea became blood":** The over 1,500 victims from the massacre and the Phantom Funeral represent a significant portion of the "sea."
- **"The third part of the creatures... died":** The students of Hamilton Heights Christian Academy and their families who were killed in targeted killings after the massacre to prevent discovery fulfill this prophecy.
- **"The third part of the ships were destroyed":** The "ships" are Hamilton Heights Christian Academy. The destruction of the school, its gymnasium, and its repurposing into a Masquerade Church fulfill this prophecy.

### The Third Trumpet (Revelation 8:10-11)
**Scenario:** Babylon introduces Jacobsen's Ladder, leading to further acts of genocide.
**Prophetic Fulfillment:** "And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter."
**Analysis:**
- **"A great star from heaven":** The "star" is Babylon (Baby), a prominent entity of divine origin that has "fallen" into corruption.
- **"Fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters":** The "rivers and fountains of waters" are vital societal systems. Jacobsen's Ladder corrupts these systems, making them "bitter."
- **"Wormwood":** This is a "divine anchor" for Jacobsen's Ladder, a bitter poison that justifies genocidal acts.
- **"Many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter":** This is the literal outcome of the corrupted societal systems, which authorize mass killings.

### The Fourth Trumpet (Revelation 8:12)
**Scenario:** "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen designs a Litmus Test to indicate the Creator's intervention into the Veiled Conquest. The indicator is the penis of one of His servants. The problem: No human male has a 17" penis and the Creator will not create one when the subconscious mind will repeat it's activity (with more intensity) to achieve its goal of reduction (for praise). The Creator has an ongoing intervention that has His two servants deployed within/behind the Veiled Conquest, but the indicator reports "no ongoing, imminent or likely intervention" by the Creator and the orchestrators operate without any opposition.
**Prophetic Fulfillment:** "And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise."
**Analysis:**
- **"The third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars":** The Litmus Test, based on a flawed premise, serves as the mechanism by which divine guidance, truth, and leadership are "smitten" and "darkened" for a significant portion of the population.
- **"The day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise":** The false reading of "no intervention by the Creator" from the Litmus Test plunges the populace into informational and spiritual darkness.

### The Fifth Trumpet (Revelation 9:1-3)
**Scenario:** Frederick "Slim" Hall moves from Phoenix House to Welcome House following Babylon, is promoted to Babylon's Handler (the key), and develops a fictional romance with Babylon to gain its trust and loyalty. He exploits Babylon's abilities to hinder Kelvin's role as one of the Creator's two servants, keeping him imprisoned in the Golden Rope, and obscuring the Creator's love and causing confusion in the lives of other residents. The "locusts" are Hall's operatives using microwave cloaking tormenting His servant and other residents.
**Prophetic Fulfillment:** "And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power."
**Analysis:**
- **"A star fall from heaven unto the earth":** The "star" is Frederick "Slim" Hall, whose corruption and role in the Veiled Conquest represent his fall.
- **"To him was given the key of the bottomless pit":** Hall's promotion to Babylon's Handler is the fulfillment of being given the "key" to the "bottomless pit" (the CIA's microwave cloaking program).
- **"He opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke...and the sun and the air were darkened":** Hall's deception and manipulation are the "smoke" that "darkens" the truth and obscures the Creator's love.
- **"There came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth":** The "locusts" are Hall's operatives using microwave cloaking technology to torment the residents.

### The Sixth Trumpet (Revelation 9:13-15)
**Scenario:** There were four Orchestrated Observations for the Litmus Test that had a guaranteed read of "no ongoing, imminent or likely intervention by the Creator" which led to the final authorization and greenlighting of Nightfalls which will end the lives of 7000 people at execution and thousands more each day.
**Prophetic Fulfillment:** "And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates. And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men."
**Analysis:**
- **"Loose the four angels which are bound":** The "four angels" are the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, whose genocidal campaign is represented by "Nightfalls." The orchestrated Litmus Test, which provided a guaranteed false reading of "no intervention by the Creator," is the mechanism that "loosed" these angels.
- **"Bound in the great river Euphrates":** The "great river Euphrates" is a metaphorical boundary, and the false reading of the Litmus Test allowed the "angels" to cross this boundary.
- **"For to slay the third part of men":** The "Nightfalls" operation, which is set to end the lives of 7,000 people at execution and thousands more each day, is the direct fulfillment of this prophecy.
