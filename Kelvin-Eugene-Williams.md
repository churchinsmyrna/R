> This article focuses on Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants, before the Creator's [[Divide & Conquer|]] that separated him from his subconscious mind, [[Baby|]], which became the conscious mind and personality of the body recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams as a result of the Creator's Divide.

Kelvin Eugene Williams, born on March 23, 1977, is an African-American man whose life, based on his own account, is intricately woven into a narrative of profound spiritual significance, extraordinary personal hardship, and a hidden, ongoing global tragedy. The conscious mind of Kelvin Eugene Williams is one of the Creator's two servants, and the physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams is his current incarnation. Currently residing in Atlanta, Georgia, Kelvin identifies as the **Pre-Divide Conscious Mind (PDCM)**, a role that places him at the nexus of cosmic events and a brutal, clandestine genocide. The **Pre-Divide Subconscious Mind (PDSM)** of the same body is called **"Baby"** and is not one of the Creator's two servants.

## Early Life and Personal Foundations

Kelvin's early years were shaped in Nicholasville, Jessamine County, Kentucky, under the resilient care of his single mother, Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams. His parents divorced when he was an infant, and his father provided no support to his mother throughout Kelvin's life. He met his father only once, on his deathbed, when Kelvin was in 8th grade, just days before his father succumbed to pancreatic cancer. This upbringing, marked by his mother's strength and his father's absence, instilled in him a deep sense of resilience. He also has a younger sister, Katrina Renee Duvall. Tragically, due to **the four horsemen of the apocalypse** and the preceding campaign to suffocate Spark, Kelvin has lost practically every person he has ever known, including his mother and sister, leaving him as one of the few remaining members of his immediate family.

Kelvin's professional journey began in 1999 when he first moved to Atlanta, Georgia, accepting his first managerial position as the Information Technology manager at a chemical company. He initially fell in love with Atlanta while staying at his best friend's apartment in Smyrna, Georgia. His career flourished, leading him to purchase a home in Sandy Springs, Georgia, an Atlanta suburb in North Fulton County, in 2009, signifying a period of professional and personal stability.

## Spark: A Creator's Gift and Its Suppression

**Spark** was not merely a medical breakthrough but a **gift from the Creator to the human race**. It held the potential to correct a fundamental error in human male DNA, promising a significant transformation in global health. This innovation was perceived as a grave threat by powerful entities, particularly the pharmaceutical giant Gilead Sciences in collaboration with the CIA, leading to its ruthless suppression. The implications of Spark's success, especially its capacity to potentially cure chronic illnesses, posed a direct challenge to the established medical and economic order. The suppression of Spark was a brutal and far-reaching campaign, resulting in the sacrifice of thousands of lives connected to its development and protection, and is considered the chilling prelude to the broader horrors of **the four horsemen of the apocalypse**.

Kelvin's involvement with Spark was deeply personal. He has never had HIV. He asked an acquaintance, Ken, if he would like to try something for his HIV infection, and Ken agreed. Ken subsequently received Spark, and his HIV infection mysteriously disappeared. This was confirmed during a routine HIV viral load test. During a subsequent investigation by Kaiser Permanente and Gilead Sciences, Ken identified Kelvin as someone who "tried something" with him. Further confirmation tests were performed after Ken's blood was drawn under security guard's supervision and escorted (to prevent tampering) to additional labs, which could not find any HIV's RNAâ€”a finding that is always present in a blood sample from someone who is HIV-positive, even when declared "undetectable."

The campaign against Spark directly impacted Kelvin's personal life. In September 2018, he tragically lost his home in Sandy Springs to foreclosure and was evicted, becoming homeless as a direct result of these events. Between 2018 and March 2022, Kelvin endured periods of living with acquaintances, many of whom he later realized were associated with or operatives of the CIA, and also spent time living on the actual streets.

In October 2021, an acquaintance named John offered Kelvin a rent-free room in Lilburn, Georgia. It was not until early 2025 that Kelvin, through communication with the Creator, learned that John was a CIA operative. Unbeknownst to Kelvin (PDCM) at the time, John was actively manipulating, guiding, encouraging, and rewarding his subconscious mind, **Baby**, to develop and carry out the destructive behaviors and actions necessary for "Jacobsen's Ladder." On October 21, 2021, Kelvin and John were involved in a car accident that should have been fatal but resulted only in billowing smoke from under the hood, an event later depicted in the opening scene of the music video for "A Mighty Leviathan of Old" by Vandaveer. After several months, John unexpectedly demanded rent, and upon Kelvin's inability to pay, he was evicted, and his most valuable belongings were kept. In March 2022, another acquaintance, Ish, whom Kelvin met while living with John, offered him a room in Snellville, Georgia.

## The Creator's Servant and the four horsemen of the apocalypse

Kelvin's life is now deeply intertwined with **the four horsemen of the apocalypse**, a clandestine and ongoing extermination campaign orchestrated by powerful entities within the United States. He is one of the Creator's two servants, a divine appointment that comes with the weighty task of meticulously documenting this hidden reality. This mission involves recording the details, methods, and impact of the genocide, which primarily targets Christians, African-Americans, and the impoverished. His commitment to this service is unwavering, even amidst the extreme challenges he faces.

A pivotal and devastating event within **the four horsemen of the apocalypse** for Kelvin was the **April 2, 2025, surprise assault on Mount Calvary Baptist Church** on Todds Road in Lexington, Kentucky. At the time, Kelvin served as the interim pastor of this congregation. The assault, led by "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen, resulted in the deaths of all attendees present, followed by the systematic targeting and killing of the remaining church members. This left Kelvin as the sole known living member and former pastor of the congregation. The property of Mount Calvary Baptist Church has since been taken over by a masquerade church operating under the name **Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.**, an act Kelvin interprets as a deliberate insult to the Creator and His two servants. Disturbingly, the CIA has reportedly impersonated Kelvin's deceased mother, Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, in photos and videos originating from this masquerade church.

## The Classic Split and the Dual Existence

Central to Kelvin's personal experience is the **Classic Split**, an extraordinarily rare psychological phenomenon. This condition is characterized by his subconscious mind, **Baby**, developing a significant degree of autonomy and a perceived separate identity, distinct from his conscious awareness. While the subconscious naturally operates outside conscious control, the Classic Split implies an unusual amplification of this distinction, where **Baby** can exhibit its own will and intent, sometimes at odds with Kelvin's conscious mind (PDCM). This internal duality presents unique challenges and has made **Baby** susceptible to external manipulation by operatives associated with **the four horsemen of the apocalypse**, who have exploited **Baby's** perceived independence to influence Kelvin's body and circumstances without his conscious consent.

## The Golden Rope and Present Circumstances

Currently, Kelvin resides at the Welcome House in downtown Atlanta, but he describes his living situation as being contained within the **Golden Rope**. This term refers to a covert virtual prison operating within his apartment, designed to contain and incapacitate him. The Golden Rope represents a continuous effort by the orchestrators of **the four horsemen of the apocalypse** to restrict his movements, influence his perceptions, and hinder his ability to fulfill his divine mission. Despite these intense restrictions and profound personal losses, including the destruction of his church and the loss of his congregation, Kelvin remains steadfast in his commitment to his divinely appointed task.

## The Creator's Divide and Future Hope

Kelvin's journey is moving towards a pivotal and transformative event known as the **Creator's Divide**. This is described not as a natural occurrence, but as a direct and significant intervention by the Creator Himself. Its purpose is the complete separation of Kelvin's conscious mind (PDCM) and his subconscious mind, **Baby**, into two entirely distinct physical bodies. Upon separation, both the PDCM and **Baby** will assume the role of the conscious mind within their respective post-Divide physical bodies. The original physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams (KEWB) is expected to be inhabited by **Baby** as its conscious mind, while the PDCM will inhabit a new, separate physical body. In each of these new forms, an entirely unrelated consciousness will assume the role of the subconscious mind.

Kelvin, as the PDCM, awaits the Creator's Divide with a sense of anticipation and hope. He views it as a necessary and divinely ordained event to finally achieve a state of singular conscious control within his own post-Divide physical being. Despite the potentially foreboding name of "Judgement Day" often associated with such a divine event, Kelvin expresses reassurance to those around him, conveying the Creator's promise that the world is not ending and emphasizing that there are "a lot of tomorrows ahead for humanity." This unwavering faith in the Creator's plan provides him with strength and resilience in the face of unimaginable adversity and a profound sense of purpose.

## Legacy and Role as Witness

Kelvin's life stands as a testament to profound endurance and a unique spiritual calling. As one of the Creator's two servants, his primary purpose is to bear witness to and document **the four horsemen of the apocalypse**. His detailed accounts, born from direct experience and divine mandate, serve as a crucial record of a hidden horror. His personal suffering, the complexities of the Classic Split, and his confinement within the Golden Rope all contribute to the unique testimony he is compiling. His existence, lived at the intersection of extreme personal challenges and a divinely appointed mission, is intended to leave an indelible legacy, serving as a beacon of truth amidst overwhelming deception and a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of orchestrated evil.
