# Nightfalls: A Genocidal False Flag Operation

**Nightfalls** refers to a meticulously planned, highly coordinated false flag operation poised to inflict catastrophic devastation upon southwest Atlanta. This event is not an act of external aggression but is orchestrated by a clandestine network of current and former high-ranking elected officials and CIA personnel within the United States. It represents the largest and deadliest orchestration within the broader context of [[The Veiled Conquest|]].

The name "Nightfalls" holds a profound and chilling significance. It was chosen by the Creator's two servants, drawing inspiration from the Creator-inspired and prophetic lyrics of Prince's song "Sign O the Times": "But if a night falls and a bomb falls, will anybody see the dawn?" This lyrical reference encapsulates the intended outcome: an event so destructive and deceptive that it threatens to obscure the very truth of its origins and leave a city in irreversible darkness.

## Strategic Context within the Apocalypse and the Veiled Conquest

Nightfalls is a core component of the [[The Veiled Conquest|]], a covert and systematic campaign of elimination targeting specific demographic groups living in the United States. This ongoing campaign, initiated by the orchestrating network in 2023, aims to reduce these populations, consolidate power, and reshape the societal landscape. The formal authorization of Nightfalls by the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, underscores the profound depth of this conspiracy and the level of governmental complicity. The operation itself is represented by the Pale Horse in Revelation.

## Operational Modus Operandi

The core of Nightfalls involves the detonation of a **GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) munition**, commonly known as the **"Mother Of All Bombs,"** via airburst over the densely populated **West End neighborhood in Atlanta, Georgia**. An airburst detonation maximizes the radius of destruction and the lethal effects of the blast.

The scheduled execution time for this initial strike is **sometime after nightfall and before dawn in June 2025**.

## Overview and Objectives

The operation is designed to achieve multiple, ruthless objectives:

* **Mass Casualties:** The primary aim is to inflict a massive loss of life within the targeted demographic in southwest Atlanta, achieving a significant reduction in the population.
* **False Flag Deception:** Immediately following the detonation, a pre-fabricated narrative will be activated to attribute the attack to a fictitious external enemy or a manufactured domestic terrorist group. This deception is crucial for diverting blame and preventing the exposure of the true orchestrators.
* **Advance Genocidal Agenda:** By significantly reducing a targeted population and creating widespread chaos, Nightfalls directly serves the overarching genocidal goals of the Veiled Conquest and the broader apocalypse.
* **Consolidation of Power:** The crisis generated by Nightfalls is intended to be exploited to justify the implementation of enhanced governmental controls, surveillance, and a further erosion of civil liberties under the guise of national security.

## Authorization Process

The plans for Nightfalls were finalized and the operation was formally authorized in **September 2024** by the orchestrators of the Veiled Conquest. **This finalization and authorization are specifically represented by the Fourth Seal and the Pale Horse in Revelation.**

The final go-ahead for Nightfalls was critically contingent upon a series of **four "Orchestrated Observations."** These observations were designed to read the indicator in the [[Ladder of Deceit's Litmus Test|Ladder of Deceit]] to collect manufactured "evidence" falsely indicating "no ongoing, imminent, or likely" divine intervention. They collectively led to the authorization and final preparations for the Nightfalls operation.

These critical observations include:

1.  [[Orchestrated Observation: April 10, 2025|Orchestrated Observation: April 10, 2025]] in Downtown Atlanta, Georgia (In-Car observation)
2.  [[Orchestrated Observation: April 21, 2025|Orchestrated Observation: April 21, 2025]] in Smyrna, Georgia
3.  [[Orchestrated Observation: May 28, 2025|Orchestrated Observation: May 28, 2025]] in Atlanta, Georgia (Publix observation)
4.  [[Orchestrated Observation: June 24, 2025|Orchestrated Observation: June 24, 2025]] in Avondale Estates

## Human Impact of a MOAB Detonation

The human impact of a MOAB detonation is catastrophic and far-reaching:

* **Vaporization/Instantaneous Death:** At ground zero and within a very close proximity, individuals will be vaporized or killed instantly by the immense heat and pressure.
* **Blast Wave Trauma:** The colossal blast wave will cause severe internal injuries, including ruptured lungs, eardrums, and internal organs. Blunt force trauma from being thrown against objects will be common.
* **Thermal Burns:** Intense thermal radiation will cause severe to fatal burns over a wide area.
* **Flying Debris:** The force of the explosion will turn everyday objects into lethal projectiles, causing severe penetrating and blunt force trauma.
* **Secondary Effects:** Survivors will face a grim reality of severe injuries, lack of immediate medical care, and potential potential exposure to contaminants, leading to high secondary mortality rates. Psychological trauma will be profound and lasting.

Nightfalls represents an unparalleled act of betrayal and violence, designed to terrorize, eliminate, and control. Its imminent execution poses an existential threat to the residents of southwest Atlanta and highlights the urgent need to expose and thwart the orchestrators of this horrific plan.
