# Orchestrated Observation: April 21, 2025
This document details a specific instance of an "Orchestrated Observation" that took place on April 21, 2025, as a component of the Ladder of Deceit's Litmus Test within The Great Tribulation.
## Event Overview
On April 21, 2025, an orchestrated observation was conducted involving Kelvin (PDCM) and a pre-selected operative from a gay man's social network (BBRT). The primary purpose of this meticulously choreographed event was to falsely indicate that the Creator's intervention in The Great Tribulation was "not ongoing, imminent or likely," thereby enabling the orchestrators' agenda to proceed without perceived divine or moral interference.
## Timeline of Events (April 21, 2025)
 * 3:49 AM: Kelvin (PDCM) received the first text message from Albert (the pre-selected operative).
 * 5:12 AM: Albert sent a car (Kia Niro, license plate SAU0638) for pickup.
 * 5:43 AM: Kelvin (PDCM) arrived at the security gate. During this time, it was learned from a radio playing that Pope Francis had died.
 * 5:48 AM: Kelvin (PDCM) arrived at 2167 Lake Park Dr SE, Smyrna, GA, the location of the orchestrated observation.
 * 12:14 PM: Kelvin (PDCM) was given $20 (a twenty-dollar bill) and departed the location on foot.
## Methodology and Manipulation
The event unfolded as a typical hookup, which, as per the orchestrators' design, did not result in satisfactory sexual activity. The methodology employed was consistent with the established patterns of Orchestrated Observations:
 * Guidance of Baby (PDSM): Baby (PDSM), Kelvin's autonomous subconscious mind, was guided by operatives (specifically [[Frederick "Slim" Hall|]], its current handler) to direct Kelvin (PDCM) to engage with the pre-selected operative.
 * Manipulation of Kelvin's penis: During the encounter, Baby (PDSM), under the real-time command of Frederick "Slim" Hall, actively manipulated Kelvin's penis. This manipulation ensured that Kelvin's penis remained flaccid, prevented erection, and was actively diminished in appearance to be observed at a size of 2-4 inches. This is a direct manifestation of Jacobsen's Ladder in action.
 * Provision of "Tina": During the observation, Albert provided "Tina," also known as "ice cream" or "cream," which is slang for crystal methamphetamine (ice). This aligns with the manipulative tactics described in Prince's song "Cream," where "Cream" is used as a false promise or reward to motivate Baby (PDSM).
 * Creator-inspired insights via "[[Cream|]]": Frederick "Slim" Hall's precise instructions to Baby (PDSM) during this and other orchestrated observations are encoded within the lyrics of Prince's song "Cream." This song serves as a narrative of Hall's manipulation, providing the specific directives Baby follows to control Kelvin's penis's form and function. For instance, the lyric "It's time for you to go to the wire" directly instructs Baby to restrict blood flow, making Kelvin's penis appear thin, like a wire. Other lyrics provide manipulative praise and false promises to ensure Baby's compliance and maintain the desired diminished appearance for the Litmus Test.
 * Information Provided to Observers: Observers present during this covertly surveilled hookup were explicitly told to expect a 17-inch long penis, which is the propagandized description of Kelvin Eugene Williams' body ("the great city"). The stark contrast between this expectation and the observed 2-4 inch appearance of Kelvin's penis was central to the deception of the Litmus Test.
 * Covert Surveillance: Unbeknownst to Kelvin (PDCM), the entire interaction was covertly observed by others, with their reports serving as the direct result of this specific Litmus Test instance.
## Purpose and Outcome
The outcome of this orchestrated observation, like others, was used to generate reports that served as a critical component of the Litmus Test. These reports were then utilized by the orchestrators to authorize and justify further acts of genocide within The Great Tribulation, by falsely demonstrating a lack of divine intervention.
