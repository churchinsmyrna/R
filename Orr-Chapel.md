# Orr Chapel

Orr Chapel was a historic church and the spiritual heart of the unincorporated town of Sandy Hook in Maury County, Tennessee. The Crawley family, who resided along Crawley Hill Road, and the Rogers family, who resided along West Sheepneck Road, were descendants of the town's original settlers and constituted the majority of its population. The two families originally settled and named the area around 1888. The church was situated alongside two cemeteries, Orr Chapel and Sheepneck Cemeteries, which were significant historical sites for the community.

During the campaign to suffocate Spark, the CIA eliminated all of the residents of Sandy Hook, who were all blood relatives of Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, one of the Creator's four maternal servants and the mother of the angel of the church in Smyrna.

## Demolition and Aftermath
Following the elimination of the Crawley and Rogers families, the residents of Sandy Hook, Orr Chapel and its adjacent cemeteries were destroyed as part of a deliberate cover-up. The CIA sold the land to a real estate developer using fraudulent practices to prevent any remaining community from challenging the transactions. As the developer began work, Orr Chapel was demolished, and both the Orr Chapel and Sheepneck Cemeteries were desecrated.

When the church's congregation from the nearby town of Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, arrived for their regular service, they discovered the church and cemeteries had been erased. Their subsequent inquiries and missing persons reports prompted the CIA to expand its killing operation, targeting anyone in Maury County who was affiliated with the church or who discussed the disappearances. The destruction of Orr Chapel stands as a chilling testament to the lengths to which powerful interests would go to conceal their actions and eliminate all witnesses.
