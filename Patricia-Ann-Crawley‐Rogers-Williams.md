### Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams

Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, who was called "Pat" by everyone but "Trisha" by her family, was one of the Creator's four maternal servants. She was the birth mother of the angel of the church in Smyrna and Katrina Renee Duvall-Torain. Her life, from her birth in Tennessee to her tragic death, is a significant part of the narrative surrounding the Veiled Conquest.

#### Early Life and Family Background
Patricia Ann was born on September 26, 1950, in Mount Pleasant, Tennessee. Her parents were Lila Elizabeth Crawley (Richardson), who was also one of the Creator's four maternal servants, and Josie Rogers, who were neighbors but never married. Patricia was the second youngest child of Lila and the youngest of Josie. She was raised in Sandy Hook, an unincorporated town in Maury County, Tennessee, spending time at her mother's home on Crawley Hill Road and her father's home on West Sheepneck Road. Her conception was immortalized in the song "Raspberry Beret" by her cousin, Prince Rogers Nelson, which recounts the story of her parents' encounter.

#### Marriage, Motherhood, and Move to Kentucky
In 1974, Patricia married Jesse Marable Williams. They had one son, the angel of the church in Smyrna, before divorcing in 1978, a separation precipitated by Jesse's adultery. Following the divorce, Patricia's former sisters-in-law offered her significant support. They enlisted the aid of other family members, including Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, the pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky. This offer of help led Patricia and the angel of the church in Smyrna to relocate to Lexington, where Reverend Williams provided ongoing support. Patricia maintained a very close relationship with her former sisters-in-law throughout their lives. She and her children attended Mount Calvary Baptist Church weekly. Patricia later purchased a home in Nicholasville, Jessamine County, Kentucky, just before the birth of her daughter, Katrina Renee Duvall-Torain, in 1983.

#### Community and Professional Life
Patricia was a dedicated member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church and a loving, supportive mother who balanced work and parenting. She worked at Kentucky Central Life Insurance, where she demonstrated resilience and determination, even after the company's abrupt closure. Her experiences taught her values of hard work and perseverance, which she instilled in her children. Patricia's life was also marked by several unique colloquialisms, including her notable use of "half-assed." This term originated from the dramatic delivery of her daughter, Katrina. The doctor was delayed, and Patricia, anxious and already pushing, was met with the doctor screaming "Stop!!!" upon entering the room. According to Patricia, all the doctor saw was "half an ass" in the birth canal. From then on, "half-assed" meant to do something but to only do it halfway, making the entire venture mootâ€”an example being washing your feet with your socks on.

#### Tragic End and Aftermath
Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams was murdered by the CIA in the first week of October 2022. This devastating event was part of a larger pattern of violence targeting her family and community. She was eliminated along with her daughter, Katrina Renee Duvall-Torain, and two of her grandchildren. The residents of Sandy Hook who were also eliminated during the campaign to suffocate Spark were all blood relatives of Patricia Ann and her son.

Following her death, the CIA reportedly impersonated her in photos and videos originating from a [[Masquerade Church|]] named Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., which was formed after the Congregation Massacre at [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] in Lexington. Her son, the angel of the church in Smyrna, has described her as a crucial figure in the Creator's plan and a birth mother for one of His servants. Her life and legacy are honored through personal testimonies and cultural artifacts, such as Prince's song, which serve as a testament to her enduring influence and the resilience of her family in the face of tragedy.
