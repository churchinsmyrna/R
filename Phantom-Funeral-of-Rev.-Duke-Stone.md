# Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone

The **Phantom Funeral** of Rev. Duke Stone was a meticulously planned event orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as part of Veiled Conquest operations. This event took place on June 7, 2024, at Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Rev. Duke Stone, a retired pastor of Hickory Valley Christian Church and principal of Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, and his wife were among the victims of a massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church on Mother's Day, May 12, 2024. The CIA, however, informed concerned parties that Rev. Stone and his wife had died in a car accident. Following this fabricated story, arrangements for their Phantom Funeral were set for June 7th and 8th, 2024.

## Overview

Phantom Funerals are a continuation of violence in Veiled Conquest operations, serving as a means to eliminate individuals who might expose covert activities. These funerals are designed to silence potential whistleblowers and maintain secrecy regarding the true nature of Veiled Conquest operations. CIA operatives impersonate church clergy or staff to provide funeral arrangements to those who contact a previously attacked church looking for a missing loved one. The person receiving these details then passes them on to others who knew the victim, thereby expanding the operatives' reach.

### Veiled Conquest Operations and Leadership Involvement

#### Donald Trump’s Veiled Conquest Involvement

Donald Trump remains deeply involved in the planning and supervision of Veiled Conquest-POW attacks and cover-up efforts. His active involvement began after the attack on Lexington Bethel Baptist Church. Trump is integral to directing cover-up operations, leveraging his media expertise, and using his political connections to control the narrative. He personally oversees the planning of attacks, while "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen and her team handle the execution and supervision of operatives.

During the Mother's Day attack on Hickory Valley Christian Church, Trump and others were on a conference bridge receiving real-time updates directly from Annie. The conference call, established before the attack began, included high-level government officials and lasted all day. Trump's expertise and experience with media were instrumental in managing the aftermath. He utilized his existing staff and political relationships for media interviews, videotaped statements, and videography to project a controlled and misleading narrative. Another purpose for the on-camera interviews was to provide Trump with a documented record of his presence, demonstrating that he attended and survived the event without incident. This footage was also intended to discredit any reporting that the Creators' servants have done.

#### Personal Attendance at Executions

On the day of the Phantom Funeral for Rev. Duke Stone, President Donald Trump and Annie Jacobsen were personally present in the announcer's booth within the gymnasium of Hamilton Heights Christian Academy. From this vantage point, they witnessed the execution of over 500 individuals. Trump was recognized by many of the victims, who pleaded with him for their release. Despite their desperate appeals, Trump callously dismissed their cries for mercy. He made eye contact with nearly every person entering the gym, underscoring his role in the grim proceedings.

According to the Creator, prior to entering the gymnasium, Trump and Jacobsen partook in the abuse of alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana, followed by engaging in oral sex while inside Trump's SUV as the motorcade remained parked outside the church. Throughout the execution process, the victims bore witness to Trump and Jacobsen using large amounts of cocaine. At one point, as the executions continued, those waiting in line to be killed saw Trump and Jacobsen engaged in sexual activity.

## Cover-Up Tactics

The cover-up tactics employed by the CIA under Trump's direction were crucial in hiding the true nature of the atrocities committed during Veiled Conquest-POW attacks. These tactics included:

1.  **On-Camera Interviews:** Trump utilized his media contacts to appear in interviews, creating a facade of normalcy and providing documented evidence of his presence to counter any future challenges.
2.  **Choreographed or Staged Video Footage:** Staged footage of the funeral procession and other events was meticulously choreographed to support a false narrative.

## Vanishing Tactics

To further prevent detection and evade accountability, the CIA employed various vanishing tactics during mass killings and Veiled Conquest-POW attacks:

1.  **Phantom Identity Scheme:** Operatives assume the identities of victims and manipulate public records to erase any trace of their existence.
2.  **Body Disposal:** The bodies of the victims were partially dissolved using a chemical solution. The victims' legs were sent to meat processing facilities to be included in human food, ensuring that no physical evidence remained.
3.  **Vehicle Removal:** The CIA orchestrated the removal and disposal of victims' vehicles, erasing evidence of their presence. Unlike previous mass killings where most cars were loaded onto trailers, this time, to further portray the phantom funeral as a legitimate funeral, a funeral procession was choreographed featuring Trump's Secret Service motorcade and around 20 vehicles driven to the church by the victims. Many of Trump's security detail drove the automobiles of victims in the procession. Videographers were strategically placed along the planned route.

### Execution at Hickory Valley Christian Church

Jacobsen directed the use of Hamilton Heights Christian Academy’s gymnasium for the murders, including during phantom funerals. Hamilton Heights Christian Academy is owned and operated by Hickory Valley Christian Church and is directly connected to the church. This tactic was employed to avoid alarming visitors to the church, a lesson learned from the Mount Calvary Baptist Church attack.

## Victim Deaths

During the Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone, 649 individuals were killed, approximately 90% of whom were Caucasian from around the Tennessee Valley. The method of execution was beheading, carried out using a chainsaw—a method chosen and previously used by Jacobsen to ensure that no one survived.

## Significance and Impact

The Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone highlights the lengths to which the CIA went to maintain control over the narrative and suppress dissent. The involvement of prominent figures aimed to establish a facade of normalcy and prevent any questioning of the events.

The phantom funeral for his wife was announced for the following day. Additional phantom funerals for Pastor Stone and his wife, along with others that were killed in the Mother's Day massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church, are already planned.

## Aftermath

Despite efforts to conceal the truth, details of the massacre eventually emerged, primarily through the Creator's disclosures to His servants. However, the general public remained largely unaware of the full extent of the atrocities committed during Veiled Conquest operations. Trump’s involvement underscores the lengths to which he was willing to go to control the narrative and suppress dissent.
