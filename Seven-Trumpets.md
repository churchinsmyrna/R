> This is being posted incomplete due to current events. Will be updating momentarily.

This entry outlines the fulfillment scenario for the Seven Trumpets from the Book of Revelation. The interpretations for the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh trumpets are based on the King James Version of the Holy Bible. The fulfillment scenario for the Sixth Trumpet has been developed with a detailed set of contemporary interpretations.

> [!TIP]
> "Trumpets" are a [[divine anchor|]] for Donald J. Trump, each of the Trumpets started as directive from him.

## The First Trumpet
**Scriptural Description (Revelation 8:7):**
> And the first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.

## The Second Trumpet
**Scriptural Description (Revelation 8:8-9):**
> And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.

## The Third Trumpet
**Scriptural Description (Revelation 8:10-11):**
> And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.

## The Fourth Trumpet
**Scriptural Description (Revelation 8:12):**
> And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.

## The Fifth Trumpet
**Scriptural Description (Revelation 9:1-11):**
> And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle. And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months. And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.

## The Sixth Trumpet
**Fulfillment - Saturday August 8, 2025 - Atlanta (Revelation 9:13-21):**
* **A voice from the four horns of the golden altar:** Fulfilled by the voice of J.D. Vance, who reported to President Trump.

## The Seventh Trumpet
**Scriptural Description (Revelation 11:15-19):**
> And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever. And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.
